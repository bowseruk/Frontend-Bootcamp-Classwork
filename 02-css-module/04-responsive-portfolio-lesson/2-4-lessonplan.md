## 1.Responsive Portfolio Challenge (180 mins)

### 1.1 Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (15 min)

* Open `challenge/solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * A portfolio is a great way for developers to put themselves out there and demonstrate their skills while having fun.

  * Your portfolio doesn't need to be fancy, but it should be informative about who you are, what you've done, and how to contact you.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to use HTML and CSS to create a portfolio site.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã We will use all of our knowledge to date. HTML, CSS, responsive layouts, and Git!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã As a developer, you need a place to showcase your work to potential employers. Let your work do the talking for you!

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Homework Requirements found in `02-Homework/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.

### 1.2 Student Do: Challenge (150 mins)

#### Your Task

This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can‚Äôt be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

With these points in mind, in this challenge you‚Äôll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It‚Äôs a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

**Note:** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

#### Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager‚Äôs needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your then the section contains titled images of the your's applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

#### Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

### 1.3 Recap (15 mins)

Take these last few minutes of class to make sure that everyone has submitted their challenge, even if it is not complete. Make sure you encourage students that were not able to finish, by reminding them that these challenges are difficult, and meant to push them.

If time allows, take a few questions from the class about areas in the challenge they had a difficult time with. If needed, use the provided solution to guide them through these questions. Remind students to utilize Office Hours if they need a more thorough explanation.
