# 05 Student Do: Initial Testing
In this activity, you reinforce and build upon the testing skills you have learned so far by writing a test for your `click-counter-testing` React application.

## Instructions
Inside of `src/App.test.js`, continue where we left off and write a failing test for the following requirements:

* Test 5:
  * **Name:** `App Component Renders the Counter Display`
  * **Test case:** Write a test that checks to see if the counter display renders properly.
* Test 6:
  * **Name:** `App Component Renders a Decrement Button`
  * **Test case:** Write a test for a decrement button.
* Test 7:
  * **Name:** `Count Is Unable to Go Below Zero and Throws Error`
  * **Test case:** Write a test that will not allow the counter to go below 0 and display an error message.
* Test 8:
  * **Name:** `Decrement Error Message Clears When Count Increment Higher Than 0`
  * **Test case:** Clear the error message on increment and counter increases.
