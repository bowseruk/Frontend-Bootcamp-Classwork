# Clicky Game

## Overview

For this activity, you'll create a memory game with React. This activity will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Instructions

1. Check out the [example solution](https://clicky-game.netlify.com/) and study the app's basic functionality.

2. Create a new React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

3. The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

4. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

7. When complete, deploy the application to Netlify.

### Bonus

To challenge yourself:

1. Build the application using React Hooks
   
2. Build the application from a Behavior-Driven Development Perspective

### Hints

* Begin by building a non-functioning static version for your Clicky Game. Then work on making the game interactive.

### Commits

As a reminder having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

* Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

  * We use the mantra “commit early and often.”  This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!

  * Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.

* Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

  * When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.
