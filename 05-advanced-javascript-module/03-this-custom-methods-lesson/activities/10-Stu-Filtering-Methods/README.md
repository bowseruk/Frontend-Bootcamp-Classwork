# ðŸ“– Filtering Methods

* As a developer, I want to search through an array of accounts and find or filter users based on criteria.

## Instructions

* Create an array of account objects that have a `firstName`, `lastName`, and a `balance`

* Use the find method to search through the array and print the first account with a balance equal to $250,000, and print it to the console.

* Use the filter method to create a new array of only Users with a last name that begins with the same letter, and print it to the console.
