# Module 13: React

## Overview

In this module, we will introduce students to React, a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We'll go over key features of the framework: JSX, components, states, props, lifecycle events, and so on.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, all of this week's activities' solved and unsolved versions include only an `src` folder. Both you and your students should scaffold out a React app **once** with Create React App, and then swap out the `src` folder for each activity. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* Students may feel a little overwhelmed with the new unusual syntax. Remind them that, at the end of the day, we're still just working with JavaScript. Prioritize making sure they understand concepts, rather than worrying about them perfectly memorizing syntax.

## Heads Up

Next week, we will learn more complex techniques for managing state in React. Avoid spending too much time on Class Components since we will be focusing primarily on using React Hooks, which can only be used at the top level of functional components.
