## 1. React Portfolio Challenge (180 mins)

### 1.1 Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (15 min)

Welcome students back to class!

* For this challenge, students will utilize the skills they have learned in `Module 12: React` to develop the initial scaffolding of their portfolio sites.
  
* Open `challenge/solved/src` and run the dev server, and explain the following:

* Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, it's time to develop the initial scaffolding for your first portfolio site as well as create and/or update other materials so that you can showcase your skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

* Part of this assignment will be to deploy the application to GitHub Pages. To do this, be sure to reference the Git Guide or refer to the [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning how to break the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build on or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã This project uses a combination of all the core React concepts that we have touched on in this unit, including managing state, rendering JSX, and passing data from parent to child.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Knowing how to build apps using React is key to remaining employer-competitive. This project gives you an opportunity to create a fully featured React app that can show off your projects and your proficiency with React.
