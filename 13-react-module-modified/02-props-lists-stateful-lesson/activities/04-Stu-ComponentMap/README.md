# Component Map

In this activity, we will map over a list of data and render components from each piece of data.

## Instructions

* Replace your React application's `src` folder with [src](starter/src). Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm start`.

* This activity uses Bootstrap, so make sure you `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';` in `index.js`.

* Open the application in your web browser and study the rendered application. Then take a minute to study the included components:

  * **App**: Our application's root component.

  * **List**: Responsible for rendering an unordered list from `props.data`.

* Modify the `List` component so that, inside of its `ul` tags, it renders one `li` tag for each item in an array of grocery objects being passed via props. Each `li` tag should display the `text` property of each grocery object. The array map method should be used for this.

* For styling purposes, give each `li` tag a class of `list-group-item`.

### Hints

* You should definitely look at [React's documentation for lists and keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html).

* See MDN documentation for [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).

* You will only need to modify the `List` component.

### BONUS

* Inside of the `List` component, render a list of **only** the groceries that **have not** been purchased. Use the [Array.prototype.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) to filter the array before mapping.
