# Fun with Forms

In this activity, we will add some new functionality to the previous form example.

## Instructions

* Replace your React application's `src` folder with [starter/src](starter/src). Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm start`.

* Update the `Form` component to add the following:

  1. A new input field that updates `this.state.password`. 
  
     * Set the initial value of `this.state.password` to an empty string.

  2. Whenever a user clicks the "Submit" button, add code to accomplish the following:

     1. If the user hasn't provided a first and last name, throw an alert saying, "Fill out your first and last name, please!"

     2. If the user has provided a first and last name but their password is fewer than 6 characters, throw an alert saying, "Choose a more secure password!" followed by the full name (e.g., "Choose a more secure password, John Smith!").

     3. Otherwise, throw an alert to greet the user (e.g., "Hello, John Smith!").
  
  3. Do not allow the user to type in a password that is longer than 15 characters (i.e., the length of the password state should never go beyond 15 characters).

### Hint

* You may want to look into using [String.prototype.substring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring) to prevent the password field from going beyond 15 characters.
