### Strategies for Class Online

#### Online Classes

Online classes require more effort in creating collaboration than in a traditional classroom space. Encourage your students to build a collaborative and engaging learning environment.

#### Online Activities

We want to ensure that all students work in pairs on activities to avoid isolation. Utilize breakout rooms in Zoom for these situations.

#### Online Peer Review

Peer review is built into the curriculum as a way for students to practice giving constructive feedback in the classroom. This element will be difficult to mirror online. Be flexible and try a few approaches to find one that works for you:

1. Use review time to extend the activity time for students.
2. Let students try peer review and see how it goes. Adjust accordingly.
3. Add more time for reviews at the end of the activity.

#### Online Teaching Strategies

1. Prebuild and assign Zoom breakout rooms to your TAs to speed up getting into and out of activities.

2. Shorten or combine review times to allow students more time on the activities.

3. During reviews, have everyone share their screen. As the instructor, you can then move between students at random, quickly holding everyone accountable and focused during reviews.

4. Assign an activity "student lead" for each student breakout group.

   * This means that one student should create, share, and invite fellow activity members to their collaboration document, whether it be a Google Doc, Miro Board, InVision Freehand, Figma Artboard, etc., based on the activity needs.

5. Disable the Zoom chat and focus all communications through Slack.

6. Shorten lecture times as much as possible to maximize activity interaction and production time. Consider combining the lecture sections at the beginning of class and using the rest of the time for activities and reviews.

7. Get creative with office hours.

   * To maximize your time, schedule 10- to 15-minute review blocks for you and the TAs to check in with each student.
   * Use a Slack poll to query your students for topic reviews, tool demos, etc.
