# 📖 Initialize Projects Using Node Package Manager (npm)

Implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to keep track of dependencies using `npm`. 

* As a developer, I want to initialize my project and create a `package.json` file.

* As a developer, I want to be able to save packages to my project.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I see the `package.json` file created in a folder.

* It's done when I have installed the `inquirer` package successfully and see it listed in the `package.json` file.

* It's done when I see the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file in the folder.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

* [npm-init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-init)

* [npm-install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install)

## 💡 Hint

It's possible that the `node_modules` folder is hidden in the `files.exclude` setting in VS Code, so don't let that throw you off if you don't see it.

## 🏆 BONUS

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge to further your knowledge:

* How does the `-y` flag save us some time when running `npm init`? What does the `-g` flag do when running `npm install`? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
