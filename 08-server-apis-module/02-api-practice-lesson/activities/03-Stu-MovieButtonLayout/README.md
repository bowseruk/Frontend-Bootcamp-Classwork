# Movie Button Layout

## Instruction

* Using your previous activity files or the starter code provided, complete the following requirements.

* Your final code should:

  * Dynamically generate at least 4 buttons, using jQuery, above the search bar.

    * Each button should be a different movie title.

  * Allow users to create new buttons upon entering text in the textbox and clicking `Add a Movie`.

  * If you finish early, begin reading about [HTML5 `data-*` attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) and how (and why) you would add them to dynamically generated elements with the [jQuery `.attr()` method](http://api.jquery.com/attr/).
