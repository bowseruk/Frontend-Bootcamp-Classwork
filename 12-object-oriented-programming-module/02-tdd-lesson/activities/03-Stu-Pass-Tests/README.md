# Pass Tests

In this activity, you will be writing code to implement functionality for the `Algo` constructor you wrote tests for in the previous activity.

## Instructions

* Open the `starter/algo.js` file in your editor.

* Starting with the `reverse` method, write code to make the tests in `tests/algo.test.js` pass.

* After completing each method, run `npm run test` in your terminal to verify that you correctly implemented the method before moving on to the next one.
