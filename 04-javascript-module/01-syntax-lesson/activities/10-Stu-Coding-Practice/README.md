# Luxury Tax Calculator

* As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will calculate how much luxury tax a hypothetical sports team will pay to sign three players.

## Instructions

* Create three variables that contain the salaries for each player (without the dollar sign or commas).
  
* Calculate and display the total salary for all three players.
  * If the team exceeded their spending limit, calculate and display the cost of the luxury tax.
  * The team's spending limit is $40,000,000.
  * The tax rate is 18%. Note that the 18% luxury tax is only paid on the the amount of salary OVER the team's spending limit. For example, if a team's payroll is $55,000,000, they only pay luxury tax on $15,000,000.
