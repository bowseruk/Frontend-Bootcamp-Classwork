# üèóÔ∏è Link External JavaScript File andLog Introduction Messages to Console Using Values Stored in Variables 

* As a developer, I want to link an external JavaScript file to an existing `index.html` file to add JavaScript functionality to my static webpage. I also want to input data about my name, the number of pets I own, and a fun fact about myself and log that introduction to the console.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I open the `index.html` file, navigate to the console, and see the message contained in the `script.js` file logged to the console. 
  
* It's done when I store a name in a variable called `personName` and this line is logged to the console: "My name is `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME`."

* It's done when I store a number in a variable called `pets` and this line is logged to the console: "I have `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_PETS` pet(s)."

* It's done when I store a fun fact in a variable called `funFact` and this line is logged to the console: "Fun fact: `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_FUNFACT`."

## üí° Hints

How can we combine values using the concatenation operator (`+`) to log a single message to the console?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge to further your knowledge:

* What happens when you concatenate two variables in a single console log using `+`? Is the result what you expected? Why or why not?
