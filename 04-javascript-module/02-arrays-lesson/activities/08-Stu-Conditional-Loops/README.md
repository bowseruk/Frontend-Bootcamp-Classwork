# 🏗️ Conditional Loops

Implement the following user story:

* As a developer I want an app that will print an array of animals, but will also alert the user if any of the animal names begin with a "c" or an "o"

## Acceptance Criteria

* Loop through the following array and log the name of each animal:

  `var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];`

* Alert the user if the first letter of an animal's name begins with a "c" or an "o"

## 💡 Hints
