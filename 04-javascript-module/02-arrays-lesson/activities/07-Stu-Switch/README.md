# 🏗️ Conditional Days of the Week

Implement the following user story:

* As a developer I want to compare the differences between if-statements and switch-case. I want to create an app where a user inputs a number between 1 and 7 and the app prints the day of the week associated with that number.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Build `if` statements to find the day of the week based on a number from 1 through 7.
  * Each statement should alert the user what day they picked
* Rebuild using switch-case
