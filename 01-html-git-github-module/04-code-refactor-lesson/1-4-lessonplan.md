## 1. Code Refactor Challenge (180 mins)

### 1.1 Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (15 min)

* Open `challenge/starter/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * During this week's challenge, you will use your new HTML and CSS skills to ensure that an existing website is accessible using the provided guidelines.

  * Accessibility is an increasingly important consideration in web design. Inclusive design aims to ensure that all users&mdash;including those with disabilities&mdash;can interact with and understand a webpage's content.

  * During this week's activities, we had a brief introduction to the use of semantic HTML and accessibility concerns. This project will require you to do some research to ensure that the goal stated in the user story and each part of the acceptance criteria is fully addressed.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning to use HTML and CSS to build a website that is accessible to all users.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will use new skills in HTML and CSS to refactor an existing webpage and build off of the accessibility concepts covered in class.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 Developers need to be able to design websites with all users in mind so that they can create inclusive user experiences and attract more users to various projects.

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Challenge Requirements found in `challenge/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.

### 1.2 Student Do: Challenge (150 mins)

#### Your Task

**Note**: Be sure to review the [Challenge Guide](./Challenge-Guide.md) and the [Good README Guide](./Good-README-Guide.md) before you start working on this assignment!

This week your challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

**Important**: An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Are you ready to jump in? Here are this week's challenge requirements:

#### User Story

```text
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

#### Resources

* [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
* [Image `alt` attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp)

#### Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

#### Getting Started

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!

### 1.3 Recap (15 mins)

Take these last few minutes of class to make sure that everyone has submitted their challenge, even if it is not complete. Make sure you encourage students that were not able to finish, by reminding them that these challenges are difficult, and meant to push them.

If time allows, take a few questions from the class about areas in the challenge they had a difficult time with. If needed, use the provided solution to guide them through these questions. Remind students to utilize Office Hours if they need a more thorough explanation.

## 2. Instructor Do: Office Hours (30 minutes)
