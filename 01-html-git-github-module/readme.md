# Module 1: HTML-Git-CSS

## Overview

In this unit, we will be welcoming our students to their first unit of our Web Development Boot Camp. We'll be walking them through the very basics of HTML/CSS, Git Version Control, and Terminal/Console commands.

## Instructor/TA Notes

First off, welcome and thank you so much for being a part of our program! Thanks to instructors/TAs like yourself, we're helping hundreds of students across the world achieve their career goals and their creative dreams.

The main goal of this unit is to help students get adjusted to an "average day" of our boot camp. Be sure to encourage students plenty and focus heavily on keeping students engaged. This unit is crucial in setting the tone for units to come.

## Career Connection

Each week, students receive a Career Connection session that ties what we learn in the classroom to the profession, along with technical interviewing practice.

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads Up

A lot of time will be spent ensuring that students have properly installed all the tools and programs from the prework.

> **IMPORTANT:** Be sure to give your students both the [Good README Guide](04-code-refactor-lesson/Good-README-Guide.md) and the [Challenge Guide](04-code-refactor-lesson/Challenge-Guide.md) during the first week of class.

### Strategies for Class Online

#### Online Classes

Online classes require more effort in creating collaboration than in a traditional classroom space. Encourage your students to build a collaborative and engaging learning environment.

#### Online Activities

We want to ensure that all students work in pairs on activities to avoid isolation. Utilize breakout rooms in Zoom for these situations.

#### Online Peer Review

Peer review is built into the curriculum as a way for students to practice giving constructive feedback in the classroom. This element will be difficult to mirror online. Be flexible and try a few approaches to find one that works for you:

1. Use review time to extend the activity time for students.
2. Let students try peer review and see how it goes. Adjust accordingly.
3. Add more time for reviews at the end of the activity.

#### Online Teaching Strategies

1. Prebuild and assign Zoom breakout rooms to your TAs to speed up getting into and out of activities.

2. Shorten or combine review times to allow students more time on the activities.

3. During reviews, have everyone share their screen. As the instructor, you can then move between students at random, quickly holding everyone accountable and focused during reviews.

4. Assign an activity "student lead" for each student breakout group.

   * This means that one student should create, share, and invite fellow activity members to their collaboration document, whether it be a Google Doc, Miro Board, InVision Freehand, Figma Artboard, etc., based on the activity needs.

5. Disable the Zoom chat and focus all communications through Slack.

6. Shorten lecture times as much as possible to maximize activity interaction and production time. Consider combining the lecture sections at the beginning of class and using the rest of the time for activities and reviews.

7. Get creative with office hours.

   * To maximize your time, schedule 10- to 15-minute review blocks for you and the TAs to check in with each student.
   * Use a Slack poll to query your students for topic reviews, tool demos, etc.
