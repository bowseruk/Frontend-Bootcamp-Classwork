# Building Up HTML

## Instructions

* In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include the following in it:

  * DOCTYPE declaration
  * Head tag with a title tag
  * H1 tag with a title of your choice
  * Embedded image
  * Three links that you will create:
    * Make the first link `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
    * Make the second link bold.
    * Make the third link a placeholder, so it goes nowhere.

* **Hint:** You should be looking up at the screen pretty often. :P

* Bonus:
  * Create an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.
  * Create an unordered list of five bands/musicians you like.
  * Create a table with two columns (animal class and animal name) and four rows of animals.
  * Use an alternate way of separating links without line breaks.
  * Embed a YouTube video of your favorite band/musician.
